def increment_int_a(someval):
    someval += 1
def increment_int_b(someval):
    someval[0] += 1
def main():
    a = 32
    increment_int_a(a)
    b = [32]
    increment_int_b(b)


1. Does the change inside increment_int_a change the variable a after the function call?
2. Does the change inside increment_int_b change the variable b after the function call?
3. If they differ answer why? if not why not?

1. No
2. Yes
3. They differ because increment_int_a passes the value and only modifies it within the scope of the function,
while increment_int_b passes the list by reference to the function, changing the value by using the address of the list outside of the function.
